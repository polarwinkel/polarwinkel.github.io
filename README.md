# My Polarwinkel-Repositorys at a Glance

This gives a brief overview of some of [my repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/polarwinkel).

## [mdtex2html](https://github.com/polarwinkel/mdtex2html)

At the time of writing the most popular one:

A python-library to convert a mixture of (github-flavored) MarkDown including LaTeX-formulas to HTML-code with the formulas coded in MathML.

Since 2023 all popular browsers support the resulting code.

## [mdTeXerPad](https://github.com/polarwinkel/mdTeXerPad)

A little like Ether-Pad, but different: You can code your `mdTeX` (see above) which is live rendered on your screen an on the ones of all the other clients.

## [PolarCloud](https://github.com/polarwinkel/PolarCloud)

A little like a personal cloud, a little like your personal wiki: Create pages in a file-tree in MarkDown or upload any other files to it!

I couldn't live without it anymore!

## [docmail](https://github.com/polarwinkel/docmail)

Manage all your paper-documents in your eMail-inbox!

## [GradeMan2](https://github.com/polarwinkel/GradeMan2)

A teacher-Tool designed to be used as your personal cloud service - or standalone on your laptop.

The successor of my [GradeMan](https://github.com/polarwinkel/GradeMan).

Both are in german language!

## [KurzFormelsammlungPhysik](https://github.com/polarwinkel/KurzFormelsammlungPhysik)

german: Just what the title says...

## [TeXercise](https://github.com/polarwinkel/TeXercise)

For Teachers: An auto-correcting exercise-server using its own, very simple learn-in-5-minutes scripting language build on MarkDown to create exercises.

You might want to store your TeXercise-exercises and more in the [TeXerBase](https://github.com/polarwinkel/TeXerBase) exercise database!

## [PolarSVGedit](https://github.com/polarwinkel/PolarSVGedit)

A lightweight online SVG-Editor designed to get the basics done quickly with the mouse, but unleashing the power of SVG in Code, live-rendering your edits.

Give it a try with the [PolarSVGedit online Live-Editor](https://polarwinkel.github.io/PolarSVGedit/PolarSVGedit.html)!

## [plotLine.js](https://github.com/polarwinkel/plotLine.js)

A JavaScript-Library / editor to quickly create good-looking diagrams from your data or graphs for mathematical functions.

Whatch the [simple example](https://polarwinkel.github.io/plotLine.js/examples/simple.html) or the [showcase](https://polarwinkel.github.io/plotLine.js/examples/showcase.html) and give it a try in the [plorLine.js online Live Editor](https://polarwinkel.github.io/plotLine.js/liveEditor/liveEditor.html)!
